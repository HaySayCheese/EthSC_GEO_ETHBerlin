# Crosschain transfers through general L2

### What is this all about?
Imagine the general-purpose Layer-2 network that provides ability to send `tokens` / `assets` / `IOU` / `binary data` / _etc_ to (almost) anyone participant of the network.  
How should it be developed? **We know it**. 

</br>

### What must be done in general?
We already have a general purpose state channels network - [GEO Protocol](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol). All we need are middleware "connectors" for it to various environments. The role of the connector - atomic mirroring of the state from the network channels to the related environment.

### What was done during the hackaton?

</br>

The goal of this _dirty hacked **prototype**_ is to provide PoC of L2 state channels,
that are covered by different blockchain ecosystems (common Layer 2 for various blockchain ecosystems, (BTC/ETH/etc)).


### How does it works?
